## Reference configuration

The `reference.conf` file is packaged in the `java-driver-core` JAR artifact. It is used at runtime
to provide default values for all configuration options (anything that is not overridden in a custom
`application.conf` or with system properties).

To view the contents of the file click [here](reference.txt).
